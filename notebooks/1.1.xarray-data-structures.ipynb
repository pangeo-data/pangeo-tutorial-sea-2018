    "Unlabeled, N-dimensional arrays of numbers (e.g., NumPy’s ndarray) are the most widely used data structure in scientific computing. However, they lack a meaningful representation of the metadata associated with their data. Implementing such functionality is left to individual users and domain-specific packages. As a result, programmers frequently encounter pitfalls in the form of questions like “is the time axis of my array in the first or third index position?” or “does my array of timestamps still align with my data after resampling?”."

Coordinates are ancillary variables used to enable fast label based indexing and alignment, building on the functionality of the pandas Index. DataArray objects also can have a name and can hold arbitrary metadata in the form of their attrs property, which can be used to further describe data (e.g. by providing units). Names and attributes are strictly for users and user-written code; in general xarray makes no attempt to interpret them, and propagates them only in unambiguous cases. In contrast, xarray does interpret and persist coordinates in operations that transform xarray objects.\n",
